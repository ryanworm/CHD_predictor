                    Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world.
                    Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of
                    clinical data analysis. 
                    <br>
                    The current global pandemic has strained healthcare systems to the point of failure all over the world. 
                    Hospitals are exceeding capacity and many routine surgeries and treatments are being delayed as more severe
                    acute cases take priority. The increased stress and psychological strain on doctors has led to increased rates 
                    of retirement and closure of practices further reducing the capacity for client care.                    
                    <br>
                    To help unburden the load, machine learning can be used to help identify high risk patients, such as those 
                    who are at risk of developing heart disease. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity in the world
                    with (XX) number of deaths attributed to its cause every year. 
                    <br>
                    By identifying individuals who are at higher risk of developing heart disease doctors can focus their efforts to those
                    individuals at the highest risk. Targeting risk factors with the highest corelation to heart disease through education 
                    and lifestyle guidance can further reduce the burden on the healthcare system. 
                    <br>
                    This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several 
                    contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors.
                    Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.
                    Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by 
                    the healthcare industry.
