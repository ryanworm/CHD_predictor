# CHD_predictor


The current pandemic has increased the strain on the health care system leading to early retirement for many doctors. 
The increase ratio of patients to doctors will require streamlined medical care. Machine learning can be utilized
to identify individuals at increased risk of heart disease and allow for early intervention. By treating heart disease 
earlier we can improve patient outcomes without needing to resort to more expensive invasive treatments. 

This application allows medical professionals to input patient data and immedietly identify at risk individuals.
